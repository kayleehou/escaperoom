            "content": "| Scrum Process and Team Outline | . Scrum Process . . Explanation in more detail: . understand instructions- this means understanding the week’s assignments and making sure we meet all the requirements | assign work to each person- based on roles, we assign individual work as well as group work | while doing the work we input onto scrum board so that it is easily accessible | collaborate during class by using think pair share, we may also need to do our own research | sprint/reflect on scores- after live grading, take time to debrief what we can improve on and what we did well, then start preparing again for next week | we will also meet daily to give updates! . Roles . Our group decided we wanted to follow this outline before our sprint, we split up the scrum team roles as followed: . scrum master: Kaylee – organize scrum board and make sure agile is followed, track issues | Backend Developer: Trey – build and maintain mechanisms that process data and perform actions, builds what you can’t see | Frontend Developer: Nico – builds front end portion of web applications which is what users see and interact with | DevOps: Ben – introduces tools and processes needed for coding and deployment to maintenance and updates. | . Agile Notes . Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software. | Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage. | Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale. | Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. | Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done. | The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation. | Working software is the primary measure of progress. | Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. | Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility. | Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential. | The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams. | At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly. | TEAM PROJECT . project on flask: . draft of code . program purpose .",
